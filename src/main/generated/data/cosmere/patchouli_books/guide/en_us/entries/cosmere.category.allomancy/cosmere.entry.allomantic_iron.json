      "text": "Iron is an Allomantic metal that, when burned, allows the user to Pull on various metal objects around them, pulling any of these objects towards them. The burning of Iron is affected by normal laws of physics, so when the user pulls upon something with more weight, it will take more iron to move this, and if the user pulls upon something with more weight than themselves, they will be pulled through the air towards the aforementioned object. The burning of Iron is used to fly, manipulate various objects, pull someone towards you (assuming that they have metal on their person), disarm somebody with a metal weapon, change the flight path of flying coins, and for a multitude of other things."
