## Overview

The Cosmere is a universe devised by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.amazon.com/Brandon-Sanderson/e/B001IGFHW6), encompassing many worlds, each with their own variation of magic.
This mod aims to bring all of that to Minecraft itself... eventually.

## Current (partially implemented) Features
There are currently several powers from Scadrial, the planet from the Mistborn series:

**Allomancy!**  
Become a [Misting or Mistborn](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy)! Consume certain types of metals based on the power you start with and burn it to access your allomantic ability!


**Feruchemy!**  
The End-Neutral art, where you get out what you put in! If you have access to [feruchemical abilities](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy), that is.


**Twinborn & Compounding!**  
The place where the powers of [allomancy and feruchemy](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Compounding) meet.


**Still not enough for you?**  
  Well there's always the [third](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hemalurgy) metallic art of Scadrial...



## Planned Features

**Surgebinding - The Stormlight Archive**  
Earn the trust and respect of one of the Radiant spren in order to gain access to the ranks of the Knights Radiant.


**AonDor - Elantris**  
Find a way to gain access to the powers of the Planet Sel and gain access to a more advanced magic.


**Awakening - Warbreaker**  
The art of combining color, Biochromatic Breath and an awakening command in order to animate an object.


**New Dimensions**  
  Perhaps the cognitive realm may interest you... Better find the nearest perpendicularity!

## Inter-Mod Compatibilities
**(Required!) CuriosAPI**  - because there's always another secretâ„¢

**JEI**  - because recipes are forever plentiful and who wants to have to google them all the time.

**HWYLA**  - Going to be including ways to get more info out of what you're looking at!

**Patchouli**  - because I love well done in-game wiki/guidance (which mine is not well done... or at all existing, yet. I will get to it!)
